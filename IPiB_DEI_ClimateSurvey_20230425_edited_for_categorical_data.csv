But one thing which I would like to mention is, agreed that there are people who listens to you when you bring up an issue but what I have seen is there are very few who actually works on it and that is something which we have to work on.

However, I would like to see more outreach activities. I know that the GLDC is trying to incorporate DEI initiatives into the tea time organized by the social cheers and thanks to the team to do so. But what we are not doing is actually talking about intense and things that matter. We can have panel discussions which is very important have some speakers like we have our colloquium (may be once a month) and most importantly we can start like an open mic events where we can share experiences and learn from one another. May be pick a topic for discussion, speak for the motion and against and have students to do so. Another thing that we can do is have an student organization for the under-represented student community within the department (like ISS have) and promote culture through that platform.","Nothing as of now. But I do feel right now things are very cluttered. Though we have certain chain of command, they are only established in pen and paper and pretty much that does not work. The students have to find the right people to get the task done. As a new grad student I always used to struggle regarding the channel I should go and I tried going through the channel established, but did not help much. Eventually, had to figure it out myself with the help of my senior grad students",2,3,1,,,,,,,,,1,,,,1,"Sometimes, there were instances which made me feel like the person on the other side feels I don't know anything and has trouble believing me or having confidence.

But the thing to understand here is why even this thought raised its just because you have an assumption and that is rooted deep. I did not mind this at all but it made me think we still have things in our unconscious that is already built. 
Another time it was one of the class, where we were discussing how to write research articles and how and where we can improve our writing. There was this comment from a professor who said ""most of the reviews that I do and have poor or unclear writing are mostly from authors whose native language is not English"" I did not like this and it made me think again there is an assumption .",2,3,1,,1,,,,,,,1,1,,,,,1,,1,1,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,No,10,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,,,2,,2,,2,,,No,"We need to have discussion panels to actually talk about the issues
Have people from the under-represented section and talk about their experience, because there are many things people do un-intentionally, and I do not blame any of them, but when we have an open discussion, it allows people to think and understand if they really care
Next, thing would be actually work on the issues from grass-root level and I understand its difficult and the path is very rocky but we need to at least start it.","This not be the right place to say this but I am going to say it anyways. The seg fees have been a big issue amongst the grad student, what I would suggest it convince the department to pay the extra 100 dollars for the International student, it might be a small amount but this would show that the department not only preach but also practice what they preach. Isn't that what we would call equity? Why should I pay more as an international student, I know the entire university works like that and I am not asking for a 180 degree change, but asking the department to cover it and set an example.

The next time this buffer needed to be made I started the process by myself, and he literally came and took it out of my hands even after I said multiple times that I had it and was following all the proper safety precautions. This has also happened when I asked a simple question about a protocol - in which case he took it out of hands despite me saying multiple times I could do it myself, I was only asking a question. He is a kind guy but these little actions make me feel as though he does not think I am capable enough to handle them myself, despite being a senior graduate student in the lab.
